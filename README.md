### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former SWE at Google who's slowly learning to cobble together videogames. So far, I've made:

[**A Short Round of Golf**](https://karpierz.itch.io/a-short-round-of-golf)  
[**Aura TD**](https://karpierz.itch.io/aura-td)  
[**Snake, but Poorly Implemented**](https://karpierz.itch.io/snake-but-poorly-implemented)  
[**Dash**](https://karpierz.itch.io/dash)  
[**AutoChess**](https://karpierz.itch.io/actually-autochess)
[**Crosswordle**](https://magikarpierz.com/games/crosswordle.html)
[**Wordle Blitz**](https://magikarpierz.com/games/wordle-blitz.html)

I also dabble in some digital art:

[**A Quiet Night**](https://karpierz.itch.io/diorama-simplified-earth)
